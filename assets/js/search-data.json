Refer to the __help directory as an example. Note that any static site generator besides Jekyll can be used, such as Hugo, Gatsby, and Pelican – adapt the instructions accordingly. Jekyll subsite . The Help subsite demonstrates how to create a subsite using Jekyll. Hugo subsite . The Task trees subsite uses Hugo for its speed in processing the hundreds of task md files, among other features. The subsite source files are under the __task_trees folder and follows Hugo’s folder structure. Spending time to read this tutorial is highly recommended before digging into Hugo’s documentation, which is less amenable to learning. Task tree Hugo subsite . Some Hugo customizations have been applied to the Task trees subsite to make it easier to update. These customizations are under the __task_trees folder. To add a new section, create a subfolder under the content folder. To add the section to the navigation menu, add this front matter to the top of a new my-subfolder-name/_index.md file: . --- title: My New Section menu: navmenu: identifier: my-subfolder-name # whether the child pages in this section will be collapsed when not selected collapsible: true # affects ordering in the navigation menu weight: 3 --- # My New Section Check out these new pages. Clicking on the section link in the navigation menu will render _index.md followed by a listing of the constituent pages. To display the list of pages elsewhere, insert {{&lt; pages_list &gt;}} at the desired location in the _index.md file. (This feature is provided by layouts/_default/list.html and layout/shortcodes/pages_list.html.) . For each page in the new subfolder, add this front matter to the page’s md file in order to display it in the navigation menu: . --- title: Page 1 within Section menu: navmenu: parent: my-subfolder-name weight: 1 --- . Note that pages and sections with a negative weight will not be shown in the navigation menu. To avoid having to set the 3-line parent property for every page, add a front matter cascade configuration under the cascade section of config.yml instead, which will set the front matter for all files in my-subfolder-name except those beginning with _: . - menu: navmenu: parent: my-subfolder-name _target: path: /my-subfolder-name/[!_]* . To further customize the menu, modify menu/header.md and menu/footer.md. HTML subsite . The Table associations subsite is simply a set of html files under the schema/html folder, which is generated by Jailer run by the make_docs GitHub Action.

(reference) . Also see GitHub’s “Creating your site” instructions. Why not use the GitHub Wiki? . GitHub Wiki has the following limitations: . | Cannot serve up html content or files, along with referenced css files | No table of content generation | No built-in diagramming markup language | While the wiki context can be organized into folder, the wiki presentation doesn’t reflect the organization | Inability to present different documentation types using different styles/themes/layouts | . GitHub Pages provides more control over web page organization and presentation – see next section. Why not use the basic GitHub Pages (without GitHub Actions)? . By default, GitHub Pages employs the Jekyll static site generator to convert md files into html files, all without any additional configuration – see GitHub Pages setup documentation. To enable additional website features and documentation presentation capabilities, a GitHub Action runs Jekyll and potentially other tools to generate the html files for GitHub Pages. The additional capabilities include: . | incorporating sets of generated html files, like Caseflow DB schema created via Jailer | generating table of contents and site navigation menu | using markup syntax to generate diagrams, like diagrams.md | enabling subsites with different website themes/layouts, like the help subsite | quick text search (provided by the Just the Docs theme) | . These capabilities open up opportunities for enhanced presentation of Caseflow documentation, which aims to make information easier to find and understand. What GitHub Actions are involved? .

If we were to just always distribute a priority case if one was available, we would see that some judges would get far more priority cases than others, just by virtue of the timing of their request.

But for nonpriority cases, we must balance the four dockets, calculating the percentage of cases that we want to come from each docket. Direct Review docket . Unlike the other dockets, cases on the Direct Review docket are distributed based on the Board’s 365 day timeliness goal. We do this by giving each Direct Review case a target_decision_date at intake of 365 days after the receipt_date (this allows the Board the option of increasing the goal, while respecting the promises made to Veterans who are already in the door). We can then mark cases as due a set number of days before their target_decision_date. We then count the number of due cases, and like we do with the priority target, divide by the total batch size (this time after excluding the count of priority cases from the denominator) to get the direct review proportion. However, this proportion would remain at zero for nearly a year, waiting for cases to become due, and this is contrary to the Board’s goal of beginning to work these cases immediately. So we will also calculate an interpolated minimum direct review proportion. We use the rate at which Direct Reviews are arriving to calculate a pacesetting proportion, or the proportion of nonpriority decision capacity that would need to go to the Direct Review docket in order to keep pace with what’s arriving. We will then interpolate between 0 and the pacesetting proportion based on the age of the oldest Direct Review in the system. Finally, to accelerate the curve out, we multiply this interpolated figure by the interpolated direct review proportion adjustment. This gives us a curve out of the direct review proportion that would look something like the following: . The “jolt” in this chart shows when the calculation switched from using the interpolated minimum to using the standard due proportion. The direct review proportion is also subject to a maximum. It currently cannot exceed 80%. This prevents a complete halt to work on other dockets should demand for direct reviews approach the Board’s capacity. ",

We count these cases at a 40% discount, reflecting the likelihood that they will come to the Board and providing a fuller picture of what is waiting. Second, the legacy docket is subject to a 10% minimum. This ensures that even as the legacy docket is winnowed, VA does not let up off the gas of finishing these older cases.

    "title": "What are tasks?",
    "content": "See all Caseflow tasks’ source code here. Tasks are how Caseflow records who has responsibility for taking action on an appeal. Tasks contain three essential pieces of information: . | Appeal. Which appeal requires this action. | Assignee. Who is supposed to take the action. The assignee can be a person, a team of people, or an abstract organization used as a placeholder for some automated action that will be taken on the appeal. | Type. The type of task implies the action that is supposed to be taken. | . | Each appeal is associated with a root task. All required tasks for the appeal will be children of this root task. | Actions or task state change can cause new tasks to be associated with the root task or its descendant tasks. | Tasks determine what actions are available to a role. | A task’s state is affected by actions taken by a user. | . | Many tasks are first assigned to an Organization. When the admin for the organization (e.g., judge, coordinator) assigns a case to an individual user, a child task (or subtask) is created and assigned to a user within that organization. The task and child task have the same type but different assigned_to_type. | When the child task is created and assigned, the parent task’s state is on_hold. | When the child task’s state is complete, a hook causes the parent task’s state to be complete. | When the child task’s state is cancelled, a hook causes the parent task’s state to be cancelled. | Task Types that do not follow the Parent Org - Child User structure are all Judge Tasks, all Attorney Tasks, and the root task. | Judge &amp; Attorney have a similar parent/child structure, but do not mimic the behavior. | This distinction is a historic artifact, rather than a deliberate choice, as those Judge &amp; Attorney task types predate Organizations. | . | . | . Task status . | Possible task status values (see task.rb: enum status): assigned, in_progress, on_hold, completed, cancelled. | A task is closed if it is completed or cancelled (see Task.closed_statuses). | task.open? is implemented as !self.class.closed_statuses.include?(status). | A task is active (task.active?) if it is assigned or in_progress (see Task.active_statuses). | Note that Task.open_statuses is implemented as active_statuses.concat([Constants.TASK_STATUSES.on_hold]), which corresponds with task.open? as long as no other status values are added. | When a status is “active” we expect properties of the task to change. When a task is not “active” we expect that properties of the task will not change. | . Cancellation reason . There are many reasons why a task might be cancelled. cancellation_reason provides a means to identify a reason for a task’s most recent cancelled status. Usually a cancelled status is a final state for a task, so we wouldn’t expect it to change again. The cancellation_reason can be cleared for a task if the task ever gets uncancelled, and a new reason can be added, should it be cancelled for a different reason. Supplemental information from users for cancellation_reason can be stored in instructions. Possible values for cancellation_reason are detailed here (see also task.rb: enum cancellation_reason): . | cancellation_reason value | Description | . | poa_change | IHP tasks are cancelled when there is a change of POA for an appeal. The IHP task for the original POA gets cancelled and a new IHP task is opened for the new POA. | . How do tasks map to the appeals process? . | For further description, see this slide deck. | Also check out this generated Task Tree documentation | . Task timestamps . Tasks all have 6 timestamps that record when certain events happen . | created_at: When the ActiveRecord was created (done automatically by rails) | updated_at: When any field of the ActiveRecord was last updated (done automatically by rails) | assigned_at: When the ActiveRecord is created, this is set to the creation datetime or what assigned_at attribute is passed to the task upon creation. It is also set when a task’s status is updated to “assigned” | started_at: When a task’s status is updated to “in_progress” | placed_on_hold_at: When a task’s status is updated to “on_hold” | closed_at: When a task’s status is updated to “completed” or “cancelled” | .

    "title": "What are Blocking Tasks?",
    "content": "What Blocking Means . There are three general ways we use the concept of “blocking” in Caseflow, one general, and two aligned with how a case processes runs. General Use Task A is blocking task B if no work can be done on Task B until Task A is completed. Examples here would include Attorney Drafting Tasks blocking Judge Decision Review, Timed Hold Tasks block any task that requests it, etc. This is implemented in two ways, via a child-task relationship of task B to task A in the task tree (eg Attorney Decision Drafting is the child of a Judge Decision Review), or by the explicit creation of Task B upon completion of Task A (eg Judge Assign Task is created when the Distribution Task completes). Blocks Distribution Tasks which block distribution are a specific case of general blocking, implemented via the child-task relationship. Tasks which block distribution are created as children of the Distribution Task. A case is ready for distribution only when all children of the Distribution Task are complete. In Evidence Window dockets, the Evidence Submission window blocks distribution. In hearing dockets, the hearing task &amp; all its children block distribution. In Direct Review, there are no tasks blocking distribution by default. All dockets may have their distribution blocked if they receive a Blocking Mail Task. Blocks Dispatch As of June 2020, there is no special handling for blocking dispatch. Only the general blocking as defined above applies. Non blocking . In Caseflow, nonblocking tasks can be worked in parallel. This is implemented by having the Tasks be on different branches. All leaf tasks on a task tree can be worked in parallel. Examples include an attorney creating two colocated tasks, or if a non-blocking Mail task comes in. The Root Task . Every Appeal has one root task. It is used as a container and tracker for the entire case’s task tree. The root task is never considered blocked. Tasks created off the Root Task can run in parallel to each other. When any child task of the root task is completed, that task is responsible for creating a new sibling on the root task to track the next stage of the case process. For example, when a Distribution task is completed, the Judge Assign task is created. When the Judge Assign task is completed, the Judge Decision Review Task with a child Attorney Decision Drafting tasks are created. Mail Tasks . Most tasks of the same type tend to behave the same. Mail Tasks are the exception to this. Some Mail tasks block Distribution, if the case has not yet been sent to a judge for drafting the decision. These mail tasks will block case distribution if they come in before the distribution, pulled June 2020. &gt; MailTask.blocking_subclasses =&gt; [\"CongressionalInterestMailTask\", \"ExtensionRequestMailTask\", \"FoiaRequestMailTask\", \"HearingRelatedMailTask\", \"PowerOfAttorneyRelatedMailTask\", \"PrivacyActRequestMailTask\", \"PrivacyComplaintMailTask\"] . Other Mail Tasks are worked in parallel. Any mail tasks that come in after a case has been distributed are created off the root task, and worked in parallel. See the Mail Tasks TaskTree Documentation . Exceptions . DecisionReviewTask and Dispatch::Tasks may follow different paradigms. Hearing Tasks follow general blocking, but may have different flow within the Hearing Task Tree Branch. In Queue, User tasks do not block their matching parent Organization Task. Rather, the pair tend to complete at the same time. Organizations tasks are used by Organization admin users to track the appeal as it is under control of their org. They also give the admin users access to reassign or cancel that user task, as appropriate. User tasks are assigned to individual users within the org to track to actual work of the case. Docket Switch Tasks . Task Behavior . The docket switch flow begins with the creation of a DocketSwitchMailTask by a user at the Clerk of the Board. This task gets created as a child of the DistributionTask to block distribution to a VLJ while the docket switch request is under review. The task gets assigned to that same user whereupon they will send the request to switch dockets to a VLJ. Sending the request to a judge closes the DocketSwitchMailTask with a status of completed, closes the parent DocketSwitchMailTask assigned to the Organization as well, and creates a DocketSwitchRulingTask. Once the VLJ decides to either grant or deny the request to switch dockets, that in turn will create either a DocketSwitchGrantedTask or DocketSwitchDeniedTask and close the DocketSwitchRulingTask with a status of completed. These are the final tasks within the docket switch task flow. Docket Switch Granted Task Tree .

Task Creation . Upon switching an appeal to a different docket type, and in turn creating a new appeal stream, the task creation process largely mimics when intaking a new appeal. All new appeals will have a RootTask and DistributionTask with a status of on_hold. The new appeal will also have a DocketSwitchGrantedTask with a status of complete which is shown in the Case Timeline and requires no action. When switching to a DirectReview docket, an InformalHearingPresentation task will be created as a child of the DistributionTask if the appellant has a VSO representing them and that VSO is configured to perform IHPs. When switching to an EvidenceSubmission docket, an EvidenceSubmissionWindowTask will be automatically created as a child of the DistributionTask and with a status of assigned. This task signifies the 90-day window during which an appellant may submit additional evidence before the appeal gets distributed to a VLJ. An InformalHearingPresentation task will also be created as a child of the DistributionTask after the 90-day evidence submission window is complete if the appellant has a VSO representing them and that VSO is configured to perform IHPs. When switching to a Hearing docket, a Hearing task will be automatically created as a child of the DistributionTask and a ScheduleHearingTask will be automatically created as a child of the Hearing task. Once these tasks are completed by scheduling and holding a hearing, the appeal will be ready for distribution to a VLJ. Tasks ineligible to switch dockets . Tasks listed below are ineligible to switch dockets. All other tasks will default to switching dockets but the user granting the request can remove these tasks from switching in the UI . | Open tasks with children | RootTask - Newly created for new appeal stream | DistributionTask - Newly created for new appeal stream | EvidenceSubmissionWindowTask &amp; children | HearingTask &amp; children | DocketSwitch tasks - New DocketSwitchGrantedTask created for new appeal stream | .
