            Goal
          </h1>
          <p>
            When a Veterans Law Judge requests cases that are ready for a
            decision, those cases are drawn from the Board’s various dockets
            according to a set of rules. Prior to the implementation of the
            Appeals Modernization Act in February 2019, there was only a single
            docket, and the distribution of cases could be done by hand. With
            AMA in place, there are now four dockets, and the rules for
            distribution have reached a level of complexity that this task now
            must be automated.
          </p>
          <p>This pages describes the rules by which cases are distributed.</p>

            Docket
          </h2>
          <p>
            A docket is a line. We can generally think of a docket like a
            first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue, however there are some exceptions
            to this rule. One is that a case must be “ready” to be distributed,
            i.e. it must have no other tasks to be completed before a decision
            is written. So a ready case will be distributed before a non-ready
            case, even if the non-ready case is ahead of it on the docket. The
            Board is also allowed a small amount of wiggle room so that it
            doesn’t have to strictly observe docket order at the cost of
            efficiency; before AMA this was known as the “docket range,” a
            number of cases that were close enough to the front of the line to
            be considered eligible to be distributed.
          </p>
          <h2 id="priority">
            <a
              href="#priority"
              class="anchor-heading"
              aria-labelledby="priority"
              ><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true">

            ></a>
            Priority
          </h2>
          <p>
            If an appellant is suffering a serious illness, in financial
            distress, or for another sufficient cause, their appeal can be
            Advanced on the Docket, or prioritized. If the appellant is older
            than 75, their appeal is automatically AOD; otherwise, they must
            file a motion requesting this status.
          </p>
          <p>
            Board decisions can be appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans
            Claims. If CAVC disagrees with the Board’s decision, they will
            remand it back to the Board for another decision. These post-CAVC
            remands are also prioritized.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no differentiation between the various reasons for
            prioritizing cases. All priority cases are prioritized equally.
          </p>
          <h2 id="genpop">
            <a href="#genpop" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="genpop"
              ><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true">

            ></a>
            Genpop
          </h2>
          <p>
            Before AMA, if a judge held a hearing with the appellant, that same
            judge would be required to write the decision on the appeal. We
            would say that this appeal is “tied to the judge.” A Veteran could
            waive this right, enabling their appeal to go to any judge. They
            would be asked to do this if the judge retired, for example. At this
            point, their case would be deemed “genpop” — eligible to go to any
            judge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under AMA, this is no longer a requirement under law. However, it is
            still preferable for an appeal to go to the same judge who heard the
            hearing, provided they are still active at the Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            An additional caveat, AOD appeals that are remanded by CAVC are tied
            to the same judge as wrote the original decision.
          </p>

            Batch size
          </h2>
          <p>
            When a judge requests a distribution of cases, they will receive a
            certain number of cases in their queue. This number is called the
            batch size. It is a multiple of the number of attorneys on the
            judge’s team (currently 3 x the number of attorneys). If the judge
            does not have their own team, for example if they are a DVC, they
            receive a set number of cases known as an alternative batch size
            (currently 15 cases).
          </p>
          <p>
            We also can calculate a number called a total batch size, which is
            the sum of all of the individual judge’s batch sizes. The total
            batch size is used as a denominator for calculating things like the
            optimal percentage of priority cases to distribute.

            Legacy docket range
          </h2>
          <p>
            The legacy docket combines hearing and non-hearing appeals. As a
            result, it is not optimal to always grab the frontmost case; there
            may be cases farther back on the docket that can only be distributed
            to this specific judge, and it will be advantageous to overall
            timeliness to distribute them ahead of genpop cases that could be
            worked by anybody. But we still need to respect docket order, and we
            do this, similar to how the legacy docket was manually managed, by
            calculating a docket range. This is the range of cases on the legacy
            docket that are close enough to the front of the line to be
            distributed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legacy docket range is equal to the total batch size, minus the
            count of priority cases, times the legacy docket proportion (see
            Docket Proportions below). A hearing case within that range is
            considered eligible to be distributed to its judge as if it was at
            the front of the line.

          <p>
            Cases considered “ready” for distribution must have all
            pre-distribution tasks completed.
          </p>

            AMA dockets
          </h1>
          <p>
            The Appeals Modernization Act created two new dockets, in addition
            to the existing “legacy” docket, and allowed VA to create as many
            additional dockets as it wants. VA decided to make one additional
            docket, bringing the total number to four.
          </p>
          <p>
            1) <em>Legacy docket.</em> The original flavor docket. This docket
            contains appeals of decisions before AMA took effect. As there was
            previously only one docket, the legacy docket contains both hearing
            and non-hearing appeals. It also has an open record, meaning that
            evidence can be added to an appeal at any time. 1)
            <em>Direct Review docket.</em> This AMA docket contains appeals
            where the Veteran has decided they do not want to add new evidence
            and do not want a hearing. To encourage people to use this option,
            the Board has promised that the average number of days to complete
            appeals on this docket will be 365 days, one year. 1)
            <em>Evidence Submission docket.</em> On this AMA docket, a Veteran
            can add evidence during the 90 days after they begin their appeal.
            There is no timeliness goal for this docket. 1)
            <em>Hearing Request docket.</em> On this AMA docket, the Veteran has
            requested a hearing with a judge. They can also submit evidence at
            their hearing, or during the 90 days after the hearing.

            Policy Objectives
          </h1>
          <p>
            In designing the automatic case distribution, there were a number of
            policy objectives that the team sought to realize.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Priority cases should be balanced among judges. No judge should
              request a distribution and receive all priority cases.
            </li>
            <li>Priority cases should be distributed quickly.</li>
            <li>
              Docket order should be respected. An appeal that has an earlier
              docket date should be distributed before one with a later docket
              date. A certain amount of allowance is made on the legacy docket,
              where some appeals are tied to judges. In this case, we’ll want to
              maximize the docket efficiency, that is the extent to which we do
              not need to look too deep on the docket to find cases for a given
              judge.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nonpriority appeals on the Direct Review docket should receive a
              decision about 365 days after VA received the form starting the
              appeal.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, the Board should also start to work some Direct Review
              cases straight away, and not just wait for one year before
              starting to work the Direct Review docket. As a result, we want to
              ramp up to the 365 day timeline.
            </li>
            <li>
              The other dockets, legacy, Evidence Submission, and Hearing
              Request, should be balanced proportionately. That is the number of
              nonpriority cases distributed from each docket should be
              proportionate to the number of cases on each docket.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clearing the legacy backlog should be prioritized, but meeting the
              Direct Review timeliness goal is a higher priority.
            </li>

            Priority Target
          </h2>
          <p>
            How much of a given distribution should be priority cases? If we
            were to just always distribute a priority case if one was available,
            we would see that some judges would get far more priority cases than
            others, just by virtue of the timing of their request. Instead,
            we’ll calculate an optimal number of cases for a given distribution
            that should be priority.

            judge’s batch size (rounding up) to get the target number of
            priority cases that should be distributed.

            We don’t have to worry about which docket priority cases come from;
            all priority cases are treated the same. But for nonpriority cases,
            we must balance the four dockets, calculating the percentage of
            cases that we want to come from each docket.

            distributed based on the Board’s 365 day timeliness goal. We do this
            by giving each Direct Review case a
            <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
              >target_decision_date</code
            >
            at intake of 365 days after the
            <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
              >receipt_date</code
            >
            (this allows the Board the option of increasing the goal, while
            respecting the promises made to Veterans who are already in the
            door). We can then mark cases as due a
            <a
              href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/a349110aa64f93561aa52297738dcf537ba28364/app/models/dockets/direct_review_docket.rb#L5"
              >set number of days</a
            >
            before their
            <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
              >target_decision_date</code
            >. We then
            <a
              href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/a349110aa64f93561aa52297738dcf537ba28364/app/models/dockets/direct_review_docket.rb#L11"
              >count the number of due cases</a
            >, and like we do with the priority target,
            <a
              href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/a349110aa64f93561aa52297738dcf537ba28364/app/models/docket_coordinator.rb#L36"
              >divide by the total batch size</a
            >
            (this time after excluding the count of priority cases from the
            denominator) to get the direct review proportion.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this proportion would remain at zero for nearly a year,
            waiting for cases to become due, and this is contrary to the Board’s
            goal of beginning to work these cases immediately. So we will also
            calculate an
            <a
              href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/a349110aa64f93561aa52297738dcf537ba28364/app/models/docket_coordinator.rb#L73"
              >interpolated minimum direct review proportion</a
            >. We use the rate at which Direct Reviews are arriving to calculate
            a pacesetting proportion, or the proportion of nonpriority decision
            capacity that would need to go to the Direct Review docket in order
            to keep pace with what’s arriving. We will then interpolate between
            0 and the pacesetting proportion based on the age of the oldest
            Direct Review in the system. Finally, to accelerate the curve out,
            we multiply this interpolated figure by the
            <a
              href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/a349110aa64f93561aa52297738dcf537ba28364/app/models/docket_coordinator.rb#L10"
              >interpolated direct review proportion adjustment</a
            >. This gives us a curve out of the direct review proportion that
            would look something like the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="/caseflow/assets/images/distribution-from-direct-docket.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            The “jolt” in this chart shows when the calculation switched from
            using the interpolated minimum to using the standard due proportion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The direct review proportion is also subject to a maximum. It
            currently cannot exceed 80%. This prevents a complete halt to work
            on other dockets should demand for direct reviews approach the
            Board’s capacity.

            Balanced dockets
          </h2>
          <p>
            The other dockets are balanced proportionate to the number of cases
            on the docket. After the direct review proportion is deducted, the
            remaining proportions are divided among the other dockets according
            to their weight, the number of cases waiting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legacy docket has two exceptions to this rule. First, in
            addition to counting the cases on the docket, we also count the
            number of cases where the Agency of Original Jurisdiction has
            received a Notice of Disagreement but where the appeal has not yet
            reached the Form 9 stage. We count these cases at a 40% discount,
            reflecting the likelihood that they will come to the Board and
            providing a fuller picture of what is waiting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, the legacy docket is subject to a 10% minimum. This ensures
            that even as the legacy docket is winnowed, VA does not let up off
            the gas of finishing these older cases. Note that the sum of this
            minimum and the direct review maximum should not exceed 100%.

            Requested
          </h2>
          <p>
            When a judge requests the distribution, we distribute cases
            according to the following steps:
          </p>
          <p>
            1) We distribute priority legacy cases that are tied to a judge. As
            many as available, up to the limit of the batch size. 1) We
            distribute priority AMA hearing cases that are tied to a judge.
            Again, as many as available. 1) We distribute nonpriority legacy
            cases that are tied to a judge. We’ll distribute as many as
            available, but they must be within the legacy docket range. 1) We
            distribute nonpriority AMA hearing cases that are tied to a judge.
            As many as available. 1) At this point, we may have distributed some
            priority appeals. We’ll deduct those appeals from the priority
            target to get the number of additional priority appeals that we
            should distribute. We ask each docket for its priority appeals that
            have been waiting the longest, and distribute the oldest ones up to
            the priority remaining number, irrespective of docket. 1) We have
            also potentially distributed some nonpriority appeals from the
            legacy and AMA hearing dockets. We’ll deduct these cases from the
            docket proportions. 1) Now we’re ready to distribute the remaining
            nonpriority cases from each of the dockets according to the updated
            docket proportions. As some of these proportions may be small, we do
            this by means of
            <a
              href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/caseflow/blob/a349110aa64f93561aa52297738dcf537ba28364/app/models/concerns/proportion_hash.rb#L31"
              >stochastic allocation</a
            >. 1) If when we try to distribute cases from a given docket, we
            find that it has no cases that are ready to distribute, we’ll
            reallocate those cases among the other dockets according to the
            docket proportions and try again until we’ve found a number of cases
            equal to the batch size.

            Priority Push
          </h2>
          <p>
            In an effort to get priority cases to judges without waiting for
            them to request cases, every Monday morning, a<code
              class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
              >PushPriorityAppealsToJudgesJob</code
            >
            is run to push ready priority cases to judges that can receive them.
            Judges can receive this push if they have an active judge team in
            caseflow and they hav not been removed from the job. DVCs are in
            charge of keeping this list of judges up to date and can add and
            remove judges from this job from the Team Management page.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure some judges are not distributed more than others, we first
            distribute all priority cases that are tied to a judge (non-genpop)
            to that respective judge. We then look at the number of cases all
            eligible judges have received in the last month (including the ones
            just distributed), calculate a target number for each judge that
            would get us as close to even as possible, and distribute the
            remaining ready priority genpop appeals based on that calculation.
            The board is in charge of manually handling any cases that cannot be
            distributed due to the associated judge being unable to receive
            cases (they have left the board, they are no longer a judge, they
            are on vacation, etc).
